## Description
A web app that was inspired by Trello and cloned only the "Kanban" function with PHP.

Since the data is managed by SQlite, after downloading, it can be started immediately by just rewriting the password with the setting file.


## Quick start
  * Copy app.template.db and rename it to app.db
  * Open config / define.php and set the password


## BackUp
(Current hidden mode) When logged in, you access export.php then download the database backup (app.db)
